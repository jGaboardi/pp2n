Originally developed as the foundational method of Gaboardi (2019).

## What is the *pp2n* method?

The *pp2n* is an original solution for allocating populations onto networks that is higher resolution than traditional methods and less computationaly complex than state-of-the-art methods (Gaboardi, 2019).

**... maybe pseudo algorithm here?...**
